This project focused on transforming a traditional small-scale pharmacy, Janta Medical Store in Muradnagar (Ghaziabad), into a data-driven business using analytical techniques and 

Excel-based dashboards. The study aimed to address key operational challenges—inefficient stock management, manual accounting, and limited customer insights—through systematic data collection, cleaning, and analysis.

Primary data were gathered over a 42-day observation period, covering 111 medicines across 10 categories and 1,122 customer visits. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure consistency, after which multiple analytical methods were applied—descriptive statistics, ABC (Pareto) analysis, time-series analysis, and customer segmentation. These revealed that roughly 29% of the SKUs (Class-A) accounted for about 79% of the total revenue, highlighting a strong Pareto concentration. Category-wise insights showed that Sexual Health, Analgesics, and Respiratory Care products dominated sales, while Class-C items contributed less than 6% of revenue.

Customer analysis segmented visitors into Regular (36%) and Occasional (64%) buyers, revealing that loyal customers contributed more than half of total revenue. Time-series analysis further identified weekly and seasonal revenue spikes linked to local health trends.

Based on these findings, SMART recommendations were proposed—such as automating Class-A reorders, rationalizing low-performing inventory, introducing loyalty programs, and pre-stocking seasonal items. The project also proposed developing a Flask or Excel dashboard for weekly KPI tracking, ARPC monitoring, and supplier lead-time reviews.

Overall, this capstone project demonstrated how structured data analysis and visualization can convert manual retail operations into a sustainable, insight-driven business model, reducing inefficiencies, improving inventory control, and enhancing customer retention for small pharmacies.
